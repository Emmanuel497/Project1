            <p style="font: size 100px;">I believe the feeling or sensation that you get from driving a fast car can change the way you drive cars. My belief started when I was a child. My uncle drove fast to every place he went. I then experienced the feeling of being in a fast car. He had a black Camaro that was designed for racing. I started to grow up with the urge of wanting to drive a fast car. I think if you feel good about doing something you can enjoy it more. I love to drive a car fast because I can let my emotions go wild like maybe my uncle did as well. I love to drive fast cars because of their style, and the sound they make.
            The feeling of driving fast is like nothing else I have ever experienced. My feeling starts when Im sitting there at stop light. I start feeling my heart beating faster, as if I was starting to run in a race. Then I start to tense up with excitement for a green light. As soon as the light turns green, I hit the gas pedal. My eyes get bigger as the car accelerates, and my body feels like itâ€™s in an elevator that is taking you forward. I close my eyes for a second, and it feels like I am traveling at the speed of light. I had driven a truck and a van and it does not feel the same. Driving a truck or a van does not feel the same. I believe the feelings of driving a fast car can change an experience.</p>

            <P style="font:size 100px;">New three-dimensional design

            <h1 style="font: size 30px;;"><b>There are many areas in which the new special-edition Bugatti Centodieci echoes the former super sports car of the 1990s. "The challenge was not to allow oneself to be captivated too much by the design of the historic vehicle and work solely in retrospect, but instead to create a modern interpretation of the shape and technology of that time," says Achim Anscheidt, Head Designer at Bugatti. Even sportier and more extreme than the Bugatti Chiron and Divo hyper sports cars, yet elegant and timeless like the La Voiture Noire, it is a one-of-a-kind Bugatti for the enthusiast.

            "We faced a number of technical challenges in terms of the development and design of the Centodieci," says Achim Anscheidt. The EB110 is a very flat, wedge-shaped and graphically quasi two-dimensional super sports car of the late 1980s. "Transporting this classic look into the new millennium without copying it was technically complex, to say the least. We had to create a new way of combining the complex aerothermal requirements of the underlying Chiron technology with a completely different aesthetic appearance."

            The flat, horseshoe-shaped radiator at the front reveals its depth only from the side view, with the newly developed, deep-seated front spoiler and the three-section air intakes providing a perfect match. The front of the Bugatti Centodieci drops very low. The iconic Bugatti horseshoe has been reduced accordingly, while the Bugatti logo Macaron sits on the hood, which is interrupted at the centre by a black element. "This allowed us to rekindle memories of EB110," says Achim Anscheidt. The optimised front section with the extended front splitter and the airflow through the hood further improve the car's aerodynamics.

            The front is subordinated to the generally low geometry of the vehicle, despite its original, predominant cooling surface. The newly developed, complex and very narrow headlamps with integrated LED daytime running lights provide the perfect match. Thanks to the newly developed lighting elements, we were stylistically free in the front and rear sections to pay respectful homage to the EB110 while at the same time transposing this appealing visual reminiscence into modern technology," says Achim Anscheidt.

            <b>The ferrari portofino(type f164) is a <i>grand touring sports car</i> produced by italian
            automotive manufacturer <i>FERRARI</i> and has 0-60mph (0-97km/h) time of 3.5 seconds.
            it is a two door <em>2+2 hard top convertible.</em> the car isnamed after the village of portofino
            in northern italy and the car succeeds the company's previous v8 grand tourer, the california T. 
            The car was unveiled at the <i>2017 Frankurt motor show</i>The 2022 Ferrari Portofino M convertible justifies its nearly quarter-million-dollar price tag with the bravado and exotica that's exemplified by the Italian supercar maker. The Ferrari's sharply sculpted body draws gazes in the light of day, and the sound of its high-revving 612-hp twin-turbo V-8 causes goosebumps in the dark of night. The Portofino M's engine sits ahead of the driver instead of behind, making room for a pair of hilariously small back seats and a rear trunk that's only useful if the folding hardtop isn't folded. What's lost in cargo space is gained in ear ecstasy when the top is dropped and the Portofino M is being raced along a sunny coast or a mountain pass. While the 2022 Portofino M's fuel economy is middling and popular driver assists cost extra, those are likely plebian concerns to those who can afford one of these magnificent machines.
